### 🚀 Skills Animation (CSS)

You can add simple CSS animations in your README using HTML, but note that GitHub might have limited support. Here's an example:

```html
<!-- Example animated skill label -->
<span style="animation: pulse 2s infinite; font-weight: bold;">Web Developer</span>

<style>
@keyframes pulse {
  0% { color: #333; }
  50% { color: #007bff; }
  100% { color: #333; }
}
</style>
